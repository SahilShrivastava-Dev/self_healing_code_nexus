# Self-Healing Code Nexus

Welcome to the **Self-Healing Code Nexus**, an innovative AI-powered application designed to detect bugs and inefficiencies in your code and suggest intelligent fixes with human approval. Built for the Accenture Google Agentic AI Hackathon, this project leverages LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit to create a futuristic, user-friendly coding assistant.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Code Analysis**: Identifies bugs, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities using advanced language models.
- **Self-Healing Capability**: Suggests and applies fixes with a confidence score, requiring user approval for deployment.
- **Visual Code Health Dashboard**: Tracks confidence scores over multiple analyses with an interactive bar chart.
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Provides detailed, collapsible explanations of the AI's fix suggestions for better understanding.
- **Save and Load Functionality**: Allows saving healed code to a file and reloading it for future use.
- **Creative Interface**: Features a customizable cyberpunk-themed UI with animations, emojis, and a dynamic layout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain openai python-dotenv streamlit pandas numpy
  ```
- An OpenAI API key (store in a `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-healing-code-nexus.git
   cd self-healing-code-nexus
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

### Running the App

1. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run nexus_app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

- **Input Code**: Enter or paste your code in the text area.
- **Activate Scan**: Click "Activate Code Scan" to analyze your code.
- **Review Analysis**: Check the issue, suggested fix, confidence score, and reasoning.
- **Deploy Fix**: Approve the fix to see the updated code.
- **Manage Code**: Save or load your healed code using the buttons.

## Project Structure

- `nexus_app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
- `.env`: Configuration file for API keys.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Theme-Based Animations**: Add dynamic visual effects based on selected themes.
- **Community Feedback**: Integrate an X posting feature for sharing anonymized results.
- **Real-Time Editing**: Enable in-app code editing with a richer editor.
